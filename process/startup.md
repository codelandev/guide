## Discovery Week Guide
### 1st day (monday)
#### Lean Canvas
**Order to Follow:** Customer Segment (Early Adopters) > Problems (Existing Alternatives) > Solution > Value Proposition (High Level Pitch) > Revenue Streams > Channels > Key Metrics > Cost Structure > Unfair Advantage

**Customer Segment::**<br>
Don't be too generic or specific. Try to find an proper target.
Anyone who share photos *too generic*
Photographers *more specific and suitable*

If there are more than one customer, separate it (e.g. B2B, B2C).

*Early Adopters:* more actionable customers

**Problem:**<br>
Pick up the top 3 problems of these early adopters. You can use the "why" technique which consists in asking *why* five times for each problem.

*Existing Alternatives:* how the early adopters solve the problem today

**Solution:**<br>
For each top 3 problems define one solution.

> An MVP is the smallest solution that delivers and captures costumer value.

**Value Proposition:**<br>
Speak in termos of *finished history benefits* instead of feature benefits. It's the value that users give to the product before using it (e.g. finding the dream job).

> For new products, the initial battle is getting noticed at all.

Avoid empty marketing promisses: fast, simple, usefull...

*High Level Pitch:* explain your value in other words. It serves to spread the meaning of the product.

**Revenue Streams:**<br>
Pricing is parte of your product. Pricing determines your customers. Keep it simple, without multiple plans. Pay attention to derivative currency when you are not charging directly (e.g. ads).

**Channels:**<br>
How will you build a path to customers? You can get some users but not enought. Start with *outbound channels* (e.g. landingpage, blog, mailing list, adwords), but you need to identify where are the scalable channels (e.g. content marketing, advertising, sales force).

**Key Metrics:**<br>
The key numbers that tell you how your business is doing. Identify the key actions that drives value to your costumers (e.g. the number of tweets for twitter). How do you define success? A number in a timeline.

Avoid vanish metrics: those metrics that don't add any knowledge about your business.

**Cost Structure:**<br>
Define your variable e fixed costs. Identify your financial balance. Then calculates how many clients you will need to achieve your metrics.

**Unfair Advantage:**<br>
It can be a industrial secret, inside information, pattent, algorithm, large network, comunity, personal authority.

> A real unfair advantage is something that cannot be easily copied or bought. - Jason Cohen

#### Hyphotesis
Write down the product hyphotesis that you are trying to solve with the MVP.

#### Pitch
Each one involved in the process should do this in a paper. Then try to figure out one that resumes all of them.

For the **[final client]**, <br>
which **[problem that needs to be solved]**, <br>
the **[product name]** <br>
is a(an) **[product category]** <br>
that **[reasons to buy it]**. <br>
Differently from **[competitors alternative]**, <br>
our product **[key difference]**. <br>
