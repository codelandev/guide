## Branches

* Choose *short* and *descriptive* names:

  ```shell
  # good
  $ git checkout -b oauth-migration

  # bad - too vague
  $ git checkout -b login_fix
  ```

* Identifiers from corresponding tickets in an external service (eg. a GitHub
  issue) are also good candidates for use in branch names. For example:

  ```shell
  # GitHub issue #15
  $ git checkout -b issue-15
  ```

* Use *dashes* to separate words.

* When several people are working on the *same* feature, it might be convenient
  to have *personal* feature branches and a *team-wide* feature branch.
  Use the following naming convention:

  ```shell
  $ git checkout -b feature-a # team-wide branch
  $ git checkout -b fl-feature-a  # Filipe Linhares's personal branch
  $ git checkout -b pm-feature-a/nick   # Patrick MÃ¼ller's personal branch
  ```

  Merge at will the personal branches to the team-wide branch (see ["Merging"](#merging)).
  Eventually, the team-wide branch will be merged to "master".

* Delete your branch from the upstream repository after it's merged (unless
  there is a specific reason not to).

  Tip: Use the following command while being on "master", to list merged
  branches:

  ```shell
  $ git branch --merged | grep -v "\*"
  ```

## Commits

* Each commit should be a single *logical change*. Don't make several
  *logical changes* in one commit. For example, if a patch fixes a bug and
  optimizes the performance of a feature, split it into two separate commits.

* Don't split a single *logical change* into several commits. For example,
  the implementation of a feature and the corresponding tests should be in the
  same commit.

* Commit *early* and *often*. Small, self-contained commits are easier to
  understand and revert when something goes wrong.

* Commits should be ordered *logically*. For example, if *commit X* depends
  on changes done in *commit Y*, then *commit Y* should come before *commit X*.


* The summary line (ie. the first line of the message) should be
  *descriptive* yet *succinct*. Ideally, it should be no longer than
  *50 characters*. It should be capitalized and written in imperative present
  tense. It should not end with a period since it is effectively the commit
  *title*:

  ```shell
  # good - imperative present tense, capitalized, fewer than 50 characters
  Mark huge records as obsolete when clearing hinting faults

  # bad
  fixed ActiveModel::Errors deprecation messages failing when AR was used outside of Rails.
  ```


*  Ultimately, when writing a commit message, think about what you would need
  to know if you run across the commit in a year from now.

* If a *commit A* depends on another *commit B*, the dependency should be
  stated in the message of *commit A*. Use the commit's hash when referring to
  commits.

  Similarly, if *commit A* solves a bug introduced by *commit B*, it should
  be stated in the message of *commit A*.

* If a commit is going to be squashed to another commit use the `--squash` and
  `--fixup` flags respectively, in order to make the intention clear:

  ```shell
  $ git commit --squash f387cab2
  ```

  *(Tip: Use the `--autosquash` flag when rebasing. The marked commits will be
  squashed automatically.)*

## Merging

* **Do not rewrite published history.** The repository's history is valuable in
  its own right and it is very important to be able to tell *what actually
  happened*. Altering published history is a common source of problems for
  anyone working on the project.

* However, there are cases where rewriting history is legitimate. These are
  when:

  * You are the only one working on the branch and it is not being reviewed.

  * You want to tidy up your branch (eg. squash commits) and/or rebase it onto
    the "master" in order to merge it later.

  That said, *never rewrite the history of the "master" branch* or any other
  special branches (ie. used by production or CI servers).

* Keep the history *clean* and *simple*. *Just before you merge* your branch:

    1. Make sure it conforms to the style guide and perform any needed actions
       if it doesn't (squash/reorder commits, reword messages etc.)

    2. Rebase it onto the branch it's going to be merged to:

       ```shell
       [my-branch] $ git fetch
       [my-branch] $ git rebase origin/master
       # then merge
       ```

       This results in a branch that can be applied directly to the end of the
       "master" branch and results in a very simple history.

       *(Note: This strategy is better suited for projects with short-running
       branches. Otherwise it might be better to occassionally merge the
       "master" branch instead of rebasing onto it.)*

* If your branch includes more than one commit, do not merge with a
  fast-forward:

  ```shell
  # good - ensures that a merge commit is created
  $ git merge --no-ff my-branch

  # bad
  $ git merge my-branch
  ```
